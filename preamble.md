# IRA Rebates API Schema Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Rebates API. This documentation provides detailed information about the JSON schemas used to interact with the API endpoints involved in managing the rebate process.  


## Understanding the Schemas

Each API endpoint requires specific JSON payloads for requests. The schemas in this documentation define:

- Required and optional fields for each request
- Data types and formats for all fields

- Validation rules and constraints

<b> These schemas are essential for ensuring your API requests are properly formatted and contain all necessary information for processing rebate-related operations.


## Common Operations

The API supports several key operations:

-  **Reservations:** Reserve rebate funds for planned improvements
-  **Redemptions:** Claim rebates for completed work
-  **Bulk Reporting:** Submit multiple records in a single request
-  **File Management:** Handle documentation and supporting files


## Using This Documentation

Each schema is presented with:
- A description of its purpose
- Complete field definitions and requirements
